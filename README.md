# Memesaredreams
Just some average memes.
Just a teenager making a website.
Living in San Francisco.
Within a coding camp.

Just chilling.
On a new computer.
Nothing much. Just doing so more edits.

So. I don't know what to write. There's not much for me. I just want to chillax. Chillaxing is a combination of chill and relax. Chill+relax=chillax. remove the l in chill, and remove the re from relax. That should leave you with chil and lax. combine both of them and get chillax.
